# Documentation Improvement Plan

This document outlines the plan for improving the Corezoid documentation to better match the
validation rules and execution algorithms in the system.

## Current State Assessment

The current documentation has several areas that need improvement:

1. **Validation Rules**: Some validation rules in the code are not fully documented
2. **Execution Algorithms**: The documentation doesn't clearly explain how processes are executed
3. **Error Handling**: Error handling patterns need more detailed examples
4. **Node-Specific Documentation**: Some node types lack comprehensive documentation
5. **Best Practices**: Some best practices are scattered across different documents

## Improvement Areas

### 1. Validation Rules

- [x] Update process-json-validation.md with comprehensive validation rules
- [x] Add task size validation documentation
- [x] Document node-specific validation requirements
- [ ] Add validation checklist for process creators
- [x] Create troubleshooting guide for common validation errors

### 2. Execution Algorithms

- [x] Create execution-algorithm.md to document process flow
- [ ] Add detailed sequence diagrams for process execution
- [ ] Document system parameters used during execution
- [x] Explain task lifecycle in more detail
- [ ] Document performance considerations for process execution

### 3. Error Handling

- [x] Update error-handling.md with comprehensive strategies
- [x] Document the dedicated error node pattern
- [ ] Add more examples of error handling for different node types
- [ ] Create error handling templates for common scenarios
- [ ] Document system error codes and their meanings

### 4. Node-Specific Documentation

- [x] Update condition-node.md with validation rules
- [x] Improve code-node.md with execution environment details
- [x] Enhance api-call-node.md with error handling patterns
- [x] Update reply-to-process-node.md with best practices
- [ ] Document all node types consistently

### 5. Best Practices

- [x] Add versioning.md for process versioning
- [x] Enhance node-positioning-best-practices.md
- [ ] Create process optimization guide
- [ ] Document testing strategies for processes
- [ ] Add security best practices

## Timeline and Priorities

1. **High Priority** (Immediate focus):

   - Validation rules documentation
   - Error handling documentation
   - Execution algorithm documentation

2. **Medium Priority** (Next phase):

   - Node-specific documentation
   - Best practices documentation
   - Troubleshooting guides

3. **Long-term** (Future improvements):
   - Interactive examples
   - Video tutorials
   - API reference documentation
   - Performance optimization guides

## Review and Verification Process

To ensure the documentation remains accurate:

1. Regular reviews against the codebase
2. Verification of examples against the actual system
3. User feedback collection and incorporation
4. Continuous updates as the system evolves

This plan will be updated as progress is made and new improvement opportunities are identified.
