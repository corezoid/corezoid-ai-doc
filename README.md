# Corezoid AI Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for Corezoid AI, a process engine platform for
creating business processes, services, and applications powered by artificial intelligence. The documentation is enhanced with AI capabilities to provide better guidance and examples.

## üîç Overview

Corezoid AI is a powerful process engine that enables:
- Visual design of business processes through connected nodes
- Data processing with various node types (API calls, code execution, conditions)
- Integration with external systems through standardized interfaces
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Creation of modular, reusable process components
- Packaging and deployment of processes in a standardized format

## üìö Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following key directories:

### Source Documentation (`/docs`)
Describes all Corezoid entities (processes, nodes, logic)

- **Process Documentation** (`/docs/process/`) - Definition, operational mechanics, and key features of Corezoid processes
  - Process JSON structure and validation requirements
  - Best practices for process design and implementation
  - Error handling patterns and escalation workflows
  - Process parameters and data flow management

- **Node Documentation** (`/docs/nodes/`) - Detailed information about all node types in Corezoid
  - Flow Control: Start, End, Condition, Delay nodes
  - Data Manipulation: Set Parameters, Code nodes
  - Integration: API Call, Git Call, Database Call nodes
  - Process Interaction: Call Process, Reply to Process nodes
  - Task Management: Queue, Get from Queue, Copy Task, Modify Task nodes

- **Task Documentation** (`/docs/tasks/`) - Definition, structure, and examples of tasks in Corezoid
