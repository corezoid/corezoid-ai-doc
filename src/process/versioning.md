# Process Versioning in Corezoid

This document outlines best practices for versioning processes in Corezoid.

## Versioning Guidelines

Process titles should include version numbers to track iterations and changes:

1. **Version Format**: Process titles should follow the format "Process Name v{X}.0"
2. **Major Versions**: Increment the X value for each major change to the process
3. **Example**: "Customer Onboarding v2.0", "Payment Processing v3.0"

## Benefits of Versioning

1. **Change Tracking**: Clear versioning helps track the evolution of processes over time
2. **Reference Point**: Team members can refer to specific versions during discussions
3. **Rollback Support**: If issues arise, you can identify which version introduced them
4. **Documentation Alignment**: Documentation can reference specific process versions

## Implementing Process Versions

When creating a new version of a process:

1. **Duplicate the Process**: Clone the existing process to preserve the original
2. **Update the Title**: Change the version number in the title
3. **Document Changes**: Add notes in the process description about what changed
4. **Update References**: Ensure any processes calling this one are updated to reference the new
   version

## Example Versioning Workflow

1. Initial process creation: "Customer Verification v1.0"
2. Minor tweaks: Keep the same version number
3. Major redesign: Create "Customer Verification v2.0"
4. Critical update: Create "Customer Verification v3.0"

## Version History Management

To maintain an accessible version history:

1. Keep older versions in an "Archive" folder
2. Document the changes between versions in a central location
3. Use labeled connections between versions to show the progression
4. Consider implementing a change log within each process description

Following these versioning practices ensures consistent, traceable evolution of your Corezoid
processes.
