# Folders in Corezoid

## Overview

A **Folder** in Corezoid is an organizational structure that helps arrange and categorize processes
in a hierarchical manner. Folders serve as containers that group related processes together,
enabling better organization, management, and navigation of complex process ecosystems.

## Structure and Components

### Core Components

1. **Folder Properties**

   - **ID**: Unique identifier for the folder (obj_id)
   - **Title**: Name of the folder
   - **Description**: Optional description of the folder's purpose
   - **Parent ID**: ID of the parent folder (0 for root folders)

2. **Folder Contents**
   - **Processes**: Executable workflows that perform specific functions
   - **Sub-folders**: Child folders that create a hierarchical structure
   - **Object Type**: Folders have obj_type=0, processes have obj_type=1

### Folder Schema

A typical folder hierarchy structure:

```
Root Folder (parent_id: 0)
├── Process A
├── Process B
└── Child Folder
    ├── Process C
    └── Process D
```

## Folder Hierarchy

Folders in Corezoid can be organized in a hierarchical structure:

1. **Root Folders**: Top-level folders with parent_id=0
2. **Child Folders**: Nested folders with parent_id pointing to another folder
3. **Multi-level Nesting**: Folders can be nested to any depth to create complex organizational
   structures

## Operational Mechanics

Folders provide a logical grouping mechanism for processes and other folders. They help in:

- **Organization**: Grouping related processes together
- **Navigation**: Creating a hierarchical structure for easier navigation
- **Access Control**: Potentially controlling access to groups of processes
- **Deployment Management**: Managing deployment of related processes together

## Usage Context

Folders facilitate various organizational scenarios, such as:

- **Project Organization**: Grouping processes related to a specific project
- **Functional Organization**: Organizing processes by their functional area
- **Environment Separation**: Separating development, testing, and production processes
- **Team Ownership**: Organizing processes by team ownership
- **Process Versioning**: Organizing different versions of processes

## Key Features

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Folders can contain both processes and other folders
- **Unique Identification**: Each folder has a unique ID
- **Descriptive Naming**: Folders can have descriptive titles and descriptions
- **Flexible Organization**: Processes can be organized according to various organizational needs

## Folder Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Define the folder with a title and optional description
2. **Organization**: Place the folder in the appropriate location in the hierarchy
3. **Population**: Add processes and sub-folders to the folder
4. **Maintenance**: Reorganize as needed when processes evolve
5. **Archiving/Deletion**: Remove folders when no longer needed

## Best Practices

- Use clear, descriptive folder names that indicate their purpose
- Create a logical hierarchy that reflects your organizational structure
- Avoid excessive nesting that makes navigation difficult
- Group related processes together in the same folder
- Consider using naming conventions for folders to indicate their purpose
- Document the purpose of each folder in its description
- Regularly review and reorganize folder structures as processes evolve

## Examples

Folders provide a hierarchical structure for organizing processes. A typical structure might look
like this:

```
Root Folder (parent_id: 0)
├── Process A
├── Process B
└── Child Folder (parent_id: Root Folder ID)
    ├── Process C
    └── Process D
```

In this structure, folders (`obj_type: 0`) act as containers for processes (`obj_type: 1`) and other
folders. The `parent_id` attribute establishes the relationship between parent and child objects.
